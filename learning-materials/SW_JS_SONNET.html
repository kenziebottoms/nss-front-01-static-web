        How like a winter hath my absence been
        From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
        What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
        What old December's bareness everywhere!
        And yet this time removed was summer's time;
        The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
        Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
        Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
        Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
        But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;
        For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
        And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
            Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
            That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
