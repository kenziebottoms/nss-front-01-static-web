## Challenge \#3: Sticky navigation bar

You will learn more about how to do this in CSS102, but if you want a challenge now, create a web page that has a navigation bar and plenty of articles so that the content goes well below the fold (fancy term for the amount of real estate that exists when the user first loads the page).

When the user scrolls now to read the rest of the content, the navigation bar should remain at the top of the page, always visible, no matter how far down the user scrolls.

## Challenge \#8

Write out 143 happy numbers up to 1,000. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).
